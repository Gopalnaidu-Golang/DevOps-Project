setup ansible
trobleshooting: unable to setup ansible
integrate ansible with jenkins
creating an ansible playbook
common issues faced during practice
run ansible playbook from jenkins
update ansible playbook to to delete and create docker containers

tagging docker image using ansible playbooks
jenkins job to deploy on docker container through dockerhub.
jenkins job to deploy a war file on docker container using ansible.

Setup Ansible:create new instance & login then do below
cmd:yum install python
    yum install python-pip
    pip install ansible
    ansible --version
    mkdir /etc/ansible
    useradd ansibleadmin then setup passwd
    visudo then shift+g to go end of file then print ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL. //so that won't ask pwd when open the server
    yum install docker
    service docker status
    service docker start
    usermod -aG docker ansadmin
    vi /etc/ssh/ssh_config. then search passwd no to yes
    service sshd reload
    su - ansadmin
    
    ssh-keygen
    ssh-copyid ansadmin@IPofDockerhost
    then go login to docker host system using ssh ansadmin@IPofDockerhost. //without pwd
    
    logout
    change hostname
    cmd:hostname ansible-control-node
    sudo su -
    
    check the communication bw the system using ping for that create host file int othe ansible system using
    got to cd /etc/ansible. 
    sudo su -//no file will be here
    sudo vi hosts
    add ipofDokcersys
    add localhost
    ping test:
    cmd: ansible all -m ping
    local host is failing to success for that add key to localhost using cmd: ssh-copy-id localhost
    then run cmd: ansible all -m ping now 2 are green.
    go back to docker host:
    create user called ansadmin
    useradd ansadmin. the set pwd
    
    integrate ansible with jenkins:
    jump into jenkins console-> go to UI-> got to managed jenkins -> configure system -> publish over ssh -> click add button then fill below options.
    name:ans lgin
    hostname: Ipofansibleserver using cmd: ip addr
    username:
    remote directory:
    use passwd authentication:
    test: success
    then create a new job : deploy_on_contsiner_using_ansible
    goto ansible servr to create new directory:
    cd /opt
    sudo mkdir docker
    sudo chown -R ansadmin:ansadmin /opt/docker.  //to give ownership to the directory[bz created as root]
    
    goto ui run job and chk copied artifacts into the ansible server.

how to login kubernetes mater system? then become root user
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa admin@masterip
wt use manifest files: deployment manifest and service manifest file
wt use of deployment file: to create pods
wt use of service file: to expose service from kube env and external web browser
when new version image created how kube deployment file recognize and recreate the pods? 
using strategy:type: rollingupdate in the deploymnet manifest file.

kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -o wide. 
kubectl get service -o wide
kubectl get deploy  --creats replicaset and pods
kubectl get service --if creats service then only access the application which is running in to the pods. or use is expose our application outside from cluster.
how to deploy deployment file?
kubectl apply -f deploy.yml
kubectl apply -f service.yml
kubectl get replicaset

introduction to kubernetes 
  setting up kubernates env
  using kubectl commands
  writing deployment and service file
  creating ansible playbook to deploy
  run a jenkins job.
trabulshooting: panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer
setup kubernetes part1:setup ubuntu server
setup kubernetes part1:setup cluster on aws
common issues: unable to access kube cluster
common issues: modify K8S instace sizes and delete kube clusters
create deployment and service using kubectl commands
create deployment and service using yaml commands
Integrate kubernates with ansible
create deployment and service using ansible
jenkins cd job to deploy on kubernetes
Automate deployment on kubenetes with ci/cd jobs
setup ci/cd job for kubernate lab

how to create a pod manifest file? 
search google: pod manifest file in kubernates then create a static pod
vi pod.yml
cmd: kubectl apply -f pod.yml
kubectl get all
kubectl describe service/sample-nginx
how to create a service manifest file?
vi service.yml
 kubectl apply -f service.yml
why we need to use lables in manifest files:
when try to access from external to select the pod using lables through loadnbalencer.


create deployment and service using kubectl commands:
deploying nginx container:
cmd: kubectl run sample-nginx --nginximagename --replica=2 --port=80   --to deployment nginx on cluster without using deployment.yml file  
access application inside cluster: cmd: wget ipofmaster:port
kubectl create deployment demo-nginx --image=nginx --replica=2 --port=80

if u access outside cluster create a service.
cmd: kubectl expose deployment sample-nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalencer.  --to create a service for nginx on cluster without using service.yml file to expose service
     kubectl get pods find port here to expose from browser that port u need to put into security group then onle possible from browser using masterip/port.
     kubectl delete pod podname
     kubectl delete deployment sample-nginx
     kubectl delete service/sample-nginx
 
jenkins cd job to deploy on kubernetes:
ansible-playbook -i /opt/kubernates/hosts /opt/kubernates/xxx_deploy.yml;ansible-playbook -i /opt/kubernates/hosts /opt/kubernates/xxx_service.yml

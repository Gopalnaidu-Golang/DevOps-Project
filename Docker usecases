trobleshooting: unable to push docker image:
If you are unable to push docker image it means that you haven't logged into dockerhub as a user which you are trying to push.
during my course, I ran playbook as a "ansadmin" user (because there is a typo in the "become: true" so it didn't execute as root user). If you are executing as a root user then you should log in to DockerHub as a root user.
in short, you can do either one of the below
1. remove or comment "become: true" in the playbook  or
2. Login to dockerhub as a root user

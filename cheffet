1.Why do containerized applications are considered lightweight and fast
Containers use miniaturized virtual machines which are light weight and faster
Containers have only application inside them, making them light weight
Containers offer exclusive compresession technology makin them light weight and faster
Containers have only the application and its required dependencies and has no kernel

2.How Chef Roles are made to define the role played by a server
 role will be uploaded to Chef server using the knife role from file command.

3.in Chef, the chef-shell recipe runs in three modes. Select the one that is NOT one of the chef-shell modes:
Standalone mode
Client mode
Solo mode

19.Who doesn't need Continuous Deployment?
 is used to indicate the chef-client the details about how a node is configured in an organization.
When does Continuous Deployment lead to Continuous Delivery?
What is the function of CI (Continuous Integration) server?
Whether containers are best means to deploy loosely coupled microservices?

What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
DevOps brings once-siloed Dev and Ops together to improve agility and achieve benefits of:
Docker helps modernize the traditional application by deploying them on cloud easily once they are containerized
Sequence of testing process
Famous ci tool

1.Which of the following aspects apply to Kubernetes Pod?
Pods are similar to container with application deployed in them directly
Pods can have multiple containers and volumes within them
Pods are connected to the network and have services exposed through ports
Each Pod will have unique IP address with its network interface in the cluster

2.Configuration Management refers to following activities
Ensure availability of all dependencies required to run the application successfully
Install, configure and start the required resources as required
Boot start the server and bring up the operation system
Manipulate the application already running on the server

3.Which model is used in Chef to achieve Desired State Configuration for specifying the configuration of systems?imparative
Declarative
Imperative
Procedural
Random

4.What does Ansible Role has to configure the server?4
Ansible role has tasks, varibles and handlers in separate folder
Ansible role is the structured way of presenting the way server need to be configured
Ansible role also has files and template files to be used while configuring the server
Ansible role has list of hosts that required to be configured

5. is the fundamental element of configuration in an organization.Recipe
Cookbook
Recipe
Node
Chef-client

6.Who doesn't need Continuous Deployment  4 th one
Where applications are large, monolithic and tightly coupled
Where ITIL processes superseeds DevOps Processes restricting release calendar
Where business continuosly wants to make frequent changes to application
Where change in app environment cannot be easily automated

7.___node_____ is used to indicate the chef-client the details about how a node is configured in an organization.
Chef-server
Cookbooks
Node
Enterprise Chef

8. what level containerization offer virtualization to support application deployment?
Containers offer virtualization at application level above the operating system
Containers offer virtualization at kernel level
Containers offer virtualization at machine level
Containers virtualize the operating system

9.which of these would NOT rank as a primary concern when choosing a DevOps tool?
Compatibility with cloud platforms, such as AWS or Azure
Integration with environmental sensors on the data center floor
Reporting and control integration with collaboration tools
Ability to integrate with other CICD tools

10.How Does Ansible Configure the production server?
Ansible connect with server to be configured through SSH and PUSH the playbook
Ansible agent on the server to be configured pulls the playbook from Ansible Server
Ansible triggers the agent on the server to be configured to fetch playbook from repository
Ansible directly configures the serve to be configured

11.How Chef Roles are made to define the role played by a server
Chef Roles are the structured of defining a cookbook having multiple recipes
Chef Roles are combination of multiple cookbooks to define the role played by server
Chef Roles are combination of Chef Resources manipulated by Recipes
Chef Roles consist of automated modules which subsequently define the role played by server

12.What is the function of CI (Continuous Integration) server
CI server function is used only for production deployments.
CI server function is to continuously integrate all changes being made and committed to repository by different developers and check for build errors.
CI server is used only to run test cases.
CI server is used for log monitoring purpose.

13.Which of these tools is not associated with DevOp
Jenkins
Chef
Puppet
Vertiv MPX Adaptive Rack PDU

14.When does Continuous Deployment lead to Continuous Delivery?
If the deployed application is meeting most of the test cases it may be pushed for delivery
When the deployed application is also ready for production, as decided by business team
When the deployed application meets all the required test cases as decided by testing team
Every deployed application may also be delivered continuously

15.how Does Ansible Configure the production server?
Ansible connect with server to be configured through SSH and PUSH the playbook
Ansible agent on the server to be configured pulls the playbook from Ansible Server
Ansible triggers the agent on the server to be configured to fetch playbook from repository
Ansible directly configures the serve to be configured

How Kubernetes service can be used to access services that are hosted in the pods?

￼
Mark


Kubernetes services are always accessed in the code using IP address associated with the Pod


Kubernetes services are always accessed using the IP address associated with the container


Kubernetes services are always accessed using the cluster IP associated with exposed service


Kubernetes services hosted in one POD can not be accessed outside the Pod
How does containerization support easy application deployment?

￼
Mark


Containers offer a mini virtual machine giving exclusive environment for application deployment


Containers can automatically take care of creating required environment to run application smoothly


Containers offer an exclusive environment with dependencies to support smooth running of applications


Containers can detect the dependency required by application automatically

Server and Client communicate to get Cookbook to configure the production server?

￼
Mark
